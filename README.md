## Guitar Quiz

WIP guitar app.

Originally I intended this as a quiz app to help me learn the notes on the guitar fretboard, and to experiment with React's new Hooks API. However, it's gotten a bit more ambitious, and I'm working towards making a more fully-featured scale and chord explorer/quiz app.

As this is a for-fun project, I have coded the music theory logic myself, instead of using a libary like [Tonal](https://github.com/danigb/tonal).
